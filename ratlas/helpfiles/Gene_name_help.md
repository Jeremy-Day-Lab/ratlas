### Gene name search

Gene names entered in the search box are automatically converted to the rat nomenclature (e.g.: `FOS`, or `fos`, or `Fos` are all read by the app as `Fos`).

However, gene names that do not yet have an official gene symbol (or did not have a symbol at the time the data was processed with selected annotation version) do not follow the standard rat nomenclature (e.g.: `LOC103694210` or `5330417C22Rik`).

Thus, to enter these gene names and avoid automatic conversion from the app, simply enter the name inside double quotes, `""` (e.g.: `"5330417C22Rik"`)

__rn7/mRatBN7.2 NOTE__: be aware that gene names without an official gene symbol often times change once a new assembly has been released. Thus, please check the rn7 annotations to find the appropriate gene name or symbol! For example the gene `"5330417C22Rik"` for rn6 is `"ENSRNOG00000020272"` in rn7.

The reference files for the __rn6__ genome implemented in the analysis of the adult NAc, primary striatal neuron culture and adult VTA were from the __Ensembl 95 release__. The updated mappings to rn7 of these same datasets implemented the __rn7 Ensembl 105__ reference files.
