# The Ratlas datasets

The Ratlas single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) datasets are currently composed of the following:

__1) The rat nucleus accumbens (NAc), with samples taken from four experimental groups:__

* Male adult rats, 1hr following saline injection
* Male adult rats, 1hr following cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)
* Female adult rats, 1hr following saline injection
* Female adult rats, 1hr following cocaine injection (20mg/kg, I.P.)
<br>

__2) Primary striatal neurons (mixed from male and female E18 rat brains and cultured to DIV11) from four experimental groups:__

* Vehicle (media alone, 1hr)
* Dopamine (50µM, 1hr)
* SKF-38393 (1µM, 1hr)
* Potassium chloride (25mM, 1hr)
<br>

### FAQ:

1. Why can't I find my gene?

	Users of the app should be aware of the feature to search by gene IDs for cases when a gene name is not assigned during the generation of the cell matrices (gene ids are typically associated with more novel genes in the rat assembly. You will normally find either a gene name or ID, not both). Please see the "Gene name search" help icon at the upper right corner of the `Choose a gene` option for more information including reference genome source and versions. We add special emphasis on this section since the addition of the rn7 mapping.
